>>> Description
    A program that executes several operations (tasks) at predetermined time intervals.

        Scheduler runs on as a single process.
        Each task has an interval time which determines when the task will be executed.
        Tasks returns to the Scheduler unless the user asked to remove it from the queue.
        Tasks can be added only when the scheduler is not Running.
        Each task has a unique ID.
        Tasks can remove themselves or other tasks.
        Stopping the Scheduler only by calling Stop or terminating the process.
